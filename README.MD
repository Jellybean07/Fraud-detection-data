# Synthetic Financial Fraud Dataset

This repository contains a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world financial transactions, useful for testing fraud detection algorithms.

## Features
- `transaction_id`: Unique identifier for the transaction
- `amount`: Transaction amount (realistic distribution)
- `location`: City where transaction occurred
- `timestamp`: ISO formatted datetime of transaction
- `is_fraud`: Binary flag indicating fraudulent activity (1 = fraud, 0 = legit)

## Generation

```bash
python generate_dataset.py
